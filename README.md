# Brute Force Dictonaries

_These are dictionary files that I collected on my own server while monitoring the network. I captured some user values from attempts to log in via SSH and decided to keep them for research purposes and possibly for sharing. So, here they are._

_Only the usernames were collected from my server; the passwords were added from Google searches and other sources._

# To-Do:
- [x] Upload usernames lists.
- [ ] Upload passwords lists.

# FAQ:

**[ ? ] Why `.dat` extensions?** <br>
> Why not?

**[ ? ] What does the number stand for?** <br>
> The number indicates the amount of lines with usernames or passwords in the lists.
